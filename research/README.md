**Interpret**: In forward propagation, with global average pooling(GAP), it will be filter-level but not pixel-level to matter the final outcome. The simple idea shared in the paper is to remove the GAP in forward propagation. In other words, we apply the weights of softmax layer to the filters, but not the pixel generated by the filter through GAP, and then upsample the filter to the same size of the original image. The auther surprisedly found the filter, which is the linear conbination of those filters before GAP function, can do weakly-supervised object localization and visualization on the input image.

We can generate a 2D image by computing gradient of unnormalized class score with respect to image pixels(in my experient, it's the target score) , taking absolute value and max over RGB channels.
