# Convolutional Neural Network Visualizations

## Summry

- Gallery
    + Resnet 
    + training process of state-of-art CNN

## Doing
- Trying to apply this visualization method to pytorch pre-train weight 
    - Guided Backpropagation Saliency
    - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Heatmap on Image (Grad-CAM)
- Seeking a small dataset with clear image to train

## To do
- Display weight distribution during training process



## CNN MileStone Model
- Alexnet
- VGG
- ResNet
- Inception
- DenseNet
- NASNet


## CNN Archtecture improvement  
- Batch norm
- ReLU
- dense block
- bottleneck block
